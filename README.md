## Overview

With the release of macOS Tahoe, Apple redesigned Launchpad and removed several beloved features that power users relied on for years. **My Launchpad** brings back that classic experience and adds even more functionality.

### What's Missing in macOS Tahoe?
- ❌ No ability to create custom app groups/folders
- ❌ Limited control over app organization
- ❌ No quick keyboard access from anywhere

### What My Launchpad Provides
- ✅ **Custom Groups** - Organize apps into folders just like the classic Launchpad
- ✅ **Full Reorganization** - Drag and drop to reorder apps and groups exactly how you want
- ✅ **Global Hotkey** - Summon the launcher instantly with ⌃⌥Space from any app
- ✅ **Persistent Layout** - Your organization is saved and syncs across sessions
- ✅ **Import/Export** - Back up your layout or transfer it to another Mac

If you miss the way Launchpad used to work, this app is for you.
