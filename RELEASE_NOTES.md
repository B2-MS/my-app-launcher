# Release Notes

## Version 1.8.4 (August 2026)

### Changes

#### Removed Automatic Cloud Restore Prompt
- **No more startup restore pop-up** - My Launchpad no longer scans cloud storage on launch or prompts you to restore a different configuration
- **Restore is now manual only** - To restore cloud settings, use **Import** in Settings and select a backup file from your iCloud or OneDrive folder

---

## Version 1.8.3 (July 2026)

### Improvements

#### App Discovery and Launch Behavior
- **Recursive app scanning** - App discovery now scans nested folders inside application directories, so newly installed apps in vendor subfolders are detected

- **Visible on first launch** - Fresh installs now default to showing the launcher at startup (`Hide on launch` default is now OFF)
- **Multi-display menu bar targeting** - Clicking the menu bar icon now opens the launcher on the display where the click occurred

### Bug Fixes

---

## Version 1.8.2 (July 2026)
