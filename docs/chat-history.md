## Session: Remove Automatic Cloud Restore Prompt (v1.8.4)
**Date:** August 20, 2026

### Prompts
1. Reported that on launch the app prompts which backup to restore, and requested removing this feature so restore is manual-only from Settings, updating all documentation, following the standard testing build workflow, and updating the repo.
2. Requested running send-it to build, verify, and push.

### Outcomes
- Removed the automatic cloud backup restore prompt shown on launch.
- Removed launch-time cloud discovery and restore APIs (`checkForCloudBackups`, `discoverCloudBackups`, `importFromCloudBackup`, `dismissCloudBackupPrompt`, `CloudBackupInfo`, `hasSignificantDifferences`).
- Kept cloud backup saving (iCloud/OneDrive toggles) and manual file Import intact.
- Updated the User Guide cloud sync section to describe manual restore via Import.
- Bumped version to 1.8.4 and updated README, RELEASE_NOTES, User Guide, and test cases (TC-024).

### Files Modified
- `Sources/ViewModels/LauncherViewModel.swift` — Removed cloud restore prompt state and methods.
- `Sources/Views/ContentView.swift` — Removed restore prompt sheet and helpers.
- `Sources/Services/DataManager.swift` — Removed cloud discovery/restore APIs.
- `Resources/Info.plist` — Version 1.8.4, build 14.
- `README.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `docs/My Launchpad User Guide.md`, `docs/test-cases.md` — Documentation updates.

2. Requested launcher menu bar behavior on multi-screen setups to open on the clicked display.
3. Requested stricter send-it documentation verification and retry-until-success behavior.
4. Requested full send-it execution after workflow updates.

### Outcomes
- Added device-specific naming for cloud backups and exported settings defaults.
- Updated menu bar click handling to open launcher on the clicked monitor.
- Hardened documentation verification and enabled automatic retry loop for send-it.
- Synced workflow and app updates to GitHub.

## Session: App Icon Fix in Deploy Script (v1.8.3)
**Date:** July 12, 2026

### Prompts
1. Reported app icon showing as blank tile in Finder.
2. Requested full rebuild, redeploy, and validation before handing back.
3. Requested documentation sync and repo commit as part of standard completion workflow.

### Outcomes
- Fixed `scripts/deploy.sh` to copy `AppIcon.icns` into the app bundle during deploy.
- Identified root cause: deploy script was missing the icon copy step, causing blank icon after every deploy.
- Full rebuild and redeploy to `/Applications` with verification.

### Files Modified
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — Added `cp Resources/AppIcon.icns` to bundle creation step.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — Added bug fix entry for missing icon.

---

## Session: App Discovery Clean Pass and Documentation Sync (v1.8.3)
**Date:** July 10, 2026

### Prompts
1. Requested default launch behavior for fresh installs to be visible on startup.
2. Reported newly installed apps were not appearing in available apps.
3. Requested a full clean pass, markdown updates, and repository sync.

### Outcomes
- Changed fresh-install default to `Hide on launch = OFF`.
- Updated app scanner to recursively discover `.app` bundles in nested directories.
- Added `/Applications/Utilities` to scan paths.
- Updated release docs and version metadata for v1.8.3.

## Session: Smoother Group Popup Animation (v1.8.1)
**Date:** April 9, 2026

### Prompts
1. Reported group popup animation is slow and not smooth, asked to test and refine
2. Reported the fix is slower and now broken (yellow background, missing frosted glass) — see screenshot
3. Confirmed the fix is MUCH better — send it, ensure all docs are updated prior to packaging and syncing

### Outcomes
- **Faster Spring Animation**: Reduced `.spring(response:)` from 0.3s to 0.2s with 0.85 damping fraction for snappier popup open/close
- **Lighter Scale Transition**: Changed `.transition(.scale.combined(with: .opacity))` to `.transition(.opacity.combined(with: .scale(scale: 0.92)))` — scales from 92%→100% instead of 0%→100%, drastically reducing GPU work
- **Consolidated Shadow**: Combined two shadows (radius 40 + radius 20) into single shadow (radius 25) — simpler rendering during animation
- **Reverted `.drawingGroup()`**: Initially added for GPU rasterization but it broke `.thickMaterial` frosted glass (caused yellow background) — removed immediately
- Key files modified:
  - `Sources/Views/ContentView.swift` — Spring response 0.2s, scale transition 0.92
  - `Sources/Views/ExpandedGroupView.swift` — Single consolidated shadow
  - `Resources/Info.plist` — Version 1.8.1, build 11

## Session: Standalone App Pinning & Edit Mode Buttons (v1.8.0)
**Date:** March 3, 2026

### Prompts
1. Requested drag-and-drop from Apps section to grid to pin apps as standalone tiles, and drag apps between groups to reorder
2. Reported nothing works — discovered binary deployed to wrong name (`AppLauncher` instead of `MyLaunchpad`), fixed deployment path
3. Reported 3 issues: drop position goes to beginning of row instead of target, can't reorder between groups (adds to group instead), wants pin icon button in edit mode
4. Requested unpin button on standalone app tiles in edit mode
5. Send it — full release workflow for v1.8.0
6. Reported User Guide missing full feature documentation for pin/unpin and grid repositioning — added Pinned Apps section, updated Drag and Drop section, updated TOC and README
7. Confirmed need for screenshots — recommended pinned-app.png, pin-button.png, unpin-button.png
8. Provided three new screenshots — wired into User Guide and pushed
9. Called out that markdown updates are part of send-it instructions but keep getting missed — strengthened send-it.md with explicit User Guide requirements and expanded release checklist
10. Asked if chat history and prompts-used were also updated — they were not, fixed now

### Outcomes
- **Standalone App Pinning**: Drag apps from Apps section to grid to pin as standalone tiles at precise position
- **Pin Button**: Orange pin icon on app tiles in DraggableAppIconView during edit mode — one-click pin to grid
- **Unpin Button**: Orange unpin icon on standalone app tiles in StandaloneAppTileView during edit mode — one-click unpin
- **Row-Aware Drop Positioning**: Rewrote `findInsertIndex` with row-based logic — calculates target row from y-coordinate, filters tiles on that row, finds closest tile by x-position
- **Inset Rect Hit Testing**: Group tile drops use 20% inset rect — center drops add to group, edge drops trigger reorder
- **Drag Between Groups**: Standalone apps can be reordered between groups without being absorbed into groups
- **Binary Name Fix**: Corrected deployment to copy to `MyLaunchpad` instead of `AppLauncher`
- **User Guide — Full Feature Docs**: Added Pinned Apps section (pin, unpin, reposition), updated Drag and Drop section, updated TOC, added 3 screenshots
- **README Updated**: Added pinned apps to Features list and Usage section
- **Send-it Instructions Strengthened**: Step 1 now requires full User Guide feature docs, not just version history; checklist expanded with 4 new items
- Key files modified:
  - `Sources/Views/ContentView.swift` — Row-aware `findInsertIndex`, inset rect for group drops, `Color.clear` drop background
  - `Sources/Views/DraggableAppIconView.swift` — Orange pin button in edit mode
  - `Sources/Views/StandaloneAppTileView.swift` — Orange unpin button in edit mode
  - `Resources/Info.plist` — Version 1.8.0, build 10
  - `README.md` — Version badge 1.8.0, Features list, Usage section
  - `RELEASE_NOTES.md` — v1.8.0 section
  - `docs/My Launchpad User Guide.md` — Pinned Apps section, Drag and Drop updates, TOC, screenshots, version history
  - `docs/instructions/send-it.md` — Strengthened User Guide requirements and release checklist

## Session: Resizable Group Tiles & Drag-Drop Fix (v1.7.0)
**Date:** March 2, 2026

### Prompts
1. Reported drag-and-drop completely broken after group resizing feature was added — groups couldn't be moved at any size
2. Multiple iterations debugging drop handler not firing with `.position()` layout
3. Switched to ZStack-level `.dropDestination` with CGPoint location-based tile hit-testing — swapping groups now works
4. Reported inserting between groups doesn't work and there's stuttering during drag
5. Fixed stuttering by removing `onContinuousHover`, adding `withAnimation` wrappers, deferring `saveData()` calls
6. Fixed insert-between by creating `insertTileAt()` function operating on `launcherTiles`
7. Reported Apps section too far below groups — fixed by replacing estimated grid height with actual computed `gridContentHeight`
8. Confirmed everything working, asked about screenshots
9. Added `group-popup 2.png` image, asked to update all markdown documentation
10. Reviewed documentation changes, confirmed images updated, asked for full markdown audit
11. Asked to send it — build, deploy, DMG, push to GitHub

### Outcomes
- **Resizable Group Tiles**: Groups can be resized to Standard (1×1), Large (2×1), Extra Large (2×2) via right-click context menu
- **Fixed Drag & Drop**: ZStack-level `.dropDestination` with CGPoint location for tile hit-testing replaces broken per-tile approach
- **Smooth Animations**: Removed `onContinuousHover`, added `withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.25))`, deferred disk writes
- **Insert Between Groups**: New `insertTileAt(groupId:index:)` function for gap drops
- **Grid Height Fix**: `@State gridContentHeight` tracks actual computed height instead of estimate
- **Documentation Updated**: README v1.7.0, RELEASE_NOTES v1.7.0 section, User Guide resizing section with new image and size table, version history in all docs
- **Info.plist**: Version bumped to 1.7.0 (build 9)

## Session: Window Positioning & Size Persistence (v1.5.3)
**Date:** January 27, 2026

### Prompts
1. Requested two features: (1) when the app is opened, ensure it is centered in the screen; (2) when closed, remember the size.
2. Requested renaming instruction files: use 'pack it' instead of 'pack it up' and 'send it' instead of 'pack it up now'.
3. Said "pack it" - execute the build/install workflow.
4. Requested two improvements: (1) the app should be sized to show all groups; (2) the app should open centered in the screen - noted it was appearing closer to the top rather than truly centered.
5. Said "pack it" again - execute the build/install workflow.
6. Said "send it" - execute the full release workflow with GitHub push.
7. Requested this conversation summary be appended to chat-history.md.

### Outcomes

  - Replaced all 5 instances of `window.center()` with the new method
  - Window now centers in the actual visible screen area, not offset toward the top
- **Implemented smart initial sizing**:
  - Created `calculateIdealWindowSize()` that computes dimensions based on group count and tile scale
  - First launch calculates optimal size (4-6 tiles per row, 700-1200 width, 500-900 height)

**Date:** January 27, 2026

### Prompts
1. Asked where skills markdown files or instructions should be located in the project.
2. Requested creating a new markdown in instructions for 'pack it up' instructions.
3. Asked if the pack it up actions were added to the file (noted I only created a template).
4. Requested opening the file for review.
5. Requested two features: (1) if a group is open and there's a click anywhere outside the group, that group should close; (2) if a group is open and settings is clicked, that group should close.
6. Noted the build wasn't rebuilt so testing wasn't possible.
7. Asked rhetorically "if you don't rebuild, how would I test?" - established expectation to always rebuild after code changes.
8. Reported the animation when opening a group is now choppy, no longer smooth.
9. Asked if the app was rebuilt and replaced for testing.
10. Requested replacing the version in Applications folder and relaunching.
11. Requested that if settings is open and a group is clicked, settings should close.
12. Confirmed "YES" - the feature worked.
13. Requested "pack it up" and ensure all markdown files (README, Release Notes, User Guide) are updated.
14. Asked if GitHub was updated.
15. Asked what the instructions are for 'pack it up'.
16. Requested updating 'pack it up' with 6 specific steps: rebuild, remove instances, remove installed version, install new version, update markdown files, run new version.
17. Requested creating 'pack it up now' with 7 steps including updating the GitHub repo.
18. Confirmed "yes" to execute the workflow.
19. Noted still seeing AppLauncher folders and asked to remove if no longer needed.
20. Confirmed the AppLauncher folder was not part of MyLaunchpad and should be deleted.
21. Requested ensuring AppLauncher is not in the GitHub repo as well.
22. Confirmed "no" - didn't need to check for a separate AppLauncher repo on GitHub.

## Session: Multi-Desktop Support (v1.5.1)
**Date:** January 22, 2026

3. Requested removing TOC links from the top of each section, keeping only the ones at the bottom.
4. Requested publishing the user guide to git.
5. Requested removing the border from the table of contents.

9. Asked if the border colors could be made transparent.

### Outcomes
- **Reformatted Table of Contents**: Changed from single-column numbered list to 2-column layout (6 rows × 2 columns) to reduce vertical height

## Session: Liquid Glass Design & Menu Bar Toggle (v1.5.0)
**Date:** January 22, 2026

### Prompts
1. Resumed from previous context about multi-select and glass design work; build had failed due to malformed code with literal `\n` characters in ContentView edit toolbar background.
2. User reported "I don't really notice a difference" after initial Liquid Glass changes were applied - effects were too subtle.
3. User confirmed "yes, it's working" after making glass effects more dramatic with thicker materials and stronger colors.
4. Requested updating menu bar icon to open the app when clicked, in addition to showing the dropdown menu.
5. Requested that clicking the menu bar icon when app is already open should hide it (toggle behavior).
6. User confirmed "this works" for the toggle behavior.
7. Requested "pack it up" - the standard workflow to update docs, rebuild, create DMG, and push to GitHub.
8. Asked if installed version was replaced with the new version.
9. Requested this conversation summary be appended to chat-history.md.

### Outcomes
- **Fixed build error**: Corrected malformed Swift code in ContentView where literal `\n` characters were inserted instead of actual newlines in the edit toolbar background modifier
- **Enhanced Liquid Glass design**: Made glass effects much more noticeable by:
  - Changed `.ultraThinMaterial` to `.thickMaterial` and `.ultraThickMaterial` throughout
  - Increased color tint opacity (purple/blue gradients from 25% to 50%)
  - Made highlight strokes brighter (white 0.4→0.7 opacity, 1→1.5 lineWidth)
  - Added colored purple shadows on group icons
  - Applied color-tinted backgrounds to main window, settings panel, and expanded groups
- **Implemented menu bar toggle**: Replaced SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` with custom `NSStatusItem` in AppDelegate:
  - Left-click now toggles app visibility (show/hide)
  - Right-click shows context menu with "Show Launcher" and "Quit" options
  - Matches the global hotkey (⌃⌥Space) toggle behavior
- **Packed and released v1.5.0**: Updated README.md (version badge, menu bar feature), RELEASE_NOTES.md (new section), created DMG (488KB), pushed to GitHub
- Key files modified:
  - `Sources/Views/ContentView.swift` - Fixed edit toolbar, enhanced glass materials for main background and settings panel

4. Requested updating all markdown files and publishing to GitHub.

### Outcomes
- **Fixed settings persistence issue**: App bundle was named "App Launcher.app" but data saved to "My App Launcher" folder - updated build.sh to create "My App Launcher.app"

  - My App Launcher.app on the left
  - Applications symlink on the right for drag-to-install
