## Getting Started

### First Launch
When you first launch My Launchpad, it will:
- Scan your Applications folder for all installed apps
- Display them in the main window
- Add a grid icon to your menu bar
- Register the global hotkey

### Auto-Start at Login
The app is configured to start automatically when you log in to your Mac. It runs in the background with a menu bar icon, ready to be summoned with the global hotkey.

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Menu Bar

<img src="../images/menu-bar.png" alt="Menu Bar" width="300">

The app displays a **grid icon** (⊞) in your menu bar. Click to open MyLaunchpad and Right-click it to access popup menu:

- **Show Launcher (⌃⌥Space)** - Opens the main launcher window
- **Quit** - Completely exits the application

The menu bar icon remains visible even when the main window is closed, indicating the app is running in the background.

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Global Hotkey

**⌃⌥Space** (Control + Option + Space)

This hotkey works system-wide to toggle the launcher window:
- Press once to **show** the launcher
- Press again to **hide** the launcher

> **Note:** The app requires Accessibility permissions for the global hotkey to work. Grant access in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**.

## Main Window

<img src="../images/main-window.png" alt="Main Window" width="600">

### Window Behavior
- **Red X (Close button)** - Hides the window (app keeps running)
- **Window Transparency** - 95% opacity for a subtle see-through effect
- The window centers on screen when opened

### Sections
The main window has two collapsible sections:

1. **Groups** - Your organized app collections
2. **Apps** - Ungrouped applications (collapsed by default)

Click the section headers to expand/collapse them.

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Search

<img src="../images/search-bar.png" alt="Search Bar" width="500">

My Launchpad includes a built-in search function to help you quickly find apps.

### Using Search

1. **Locate the Search Bar** - The search bar is located in the toolbar at the top of the main window, next to the settings gear icon
2. **Type to Search** - Simply start typing the name of the app you're looking for
3. **Real-Time Filtering** - Results filter instantly as you type

<img src="../images/search-filter.png" alt="Search Bar" width="500">

### How Search Works

- **Case-Insensitive** - Search is not case-sensitive, so "Safari", "safari", and "SAFARI" all work the same
- **Partial Matching** - You can type any part of an app's name to find it (e.g., typing "note" will find "Notes")
- **Searches All Apps** - The search filters both ungrouped apps and apps within groups
- **Groups with Matches** - When searching, groups that contain matching apps will show only those matching apps when expanded

### Clearing Search

To clear your search and show all apps again:
- Delete the text in the search field, or
- Click the X button in the search field (if visible)

> **Tip:** Search is a great way to quickly launch apps without scrolling through your groups. Just press ⌃⌥Space to open the launcher, type a few letters of the app name, and click to launch!

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

## Groups

<img src="../images/groups.png" alt="Groups" width="600">

Groups let you organize apps into collections (like iOS folders).

### Creating a Group
1. Enter **Edit Mode** (click the pencil icon or use settings)
2. Select multiple apps
3. Click "Create Group" or right-click and select "Create New Group"

### Group Display Modes

#### Expanded Mode (Default)
Shows a preview grid of apps in the group. The number of preview icons depends on the group's tile size (4 for Standard, 8 for Large, 16 for Extra Large).

#### Collapsed Mode
Shows a folder icon with a badge indicating the number of apps.

Toggle between modes by clicking the chevron button that appears when hovering over a group.

### Opening a Group
Click on a group to open it in an expanded popup view showing all apps inside.

### Renaming a Group
In the group popup, click the group name in the header to edit it.

### Resizing Groups

<img src="../images/group-popup 2.png" alt="Resize Group" width="500">

Groups can be resized to show more app icons at a glance. Right-click on any group and select **"Resize Group"** to choose from three sizes:

| Size | Grid | Apps Shown | Description |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| **Standard (1x1)** | 2x2 | 4 | Default single tile |
| **Large (2x1)** | 4x2 | 8 | Double-wide tile |
| **Extra Large (2x2)** | 4x4 | 16 | Double-wide, double-tall tile |

> **Tip:** Use larger tile sizes for your most-used groups so you can see and access more apps without opening the group.

### Group Popup Features

<img src="../images/group-popup.png" alt="Group Popup" width="500">

- **Pagination** - Groups with more than 16 apps show multiple pages
- **Page Navigation** - Use arrows or dots at the bottom to navigate pages
- **Swipe Gestures** - Two-finger horizontal swipe on trackpad to navigate between pages
- **Edge Drag Zones** - Drag an app to the left/right edge to flip pages while maintaining the drag
- **Empty Slots** - Moving an app to another page leaves an empty slot (up to 4 per page)
- **Close** - Click the X button, click outside the popup, or click the settings gear

### Moving Apps Between Pages

When a group has multiple pages, you can move apps between pages using the iPad-style drag interface:

#### Drag to Edge (Recommended)
Drag an app to the **left or right edge** of the group popup window:
- The page will flip after a brief hover (0.4 seconds)
- Continue dragging to position the app anywhere on the new page
- The app fills the first available empty slot, or can be dropped on a specific position
- An empty slot is left on the source page (up to 4 per page)

#### Trackpad Swipe
Use a **two-finger horizontal swipe** on your trackpad to navigate between pages (when not dragging).

#### Drag to Page Dot
Drag an app directly onto a **page indicator dot** at the bottom to move it to that specific page.

#### Context Menu
Right-click an app and select **"Move to Page →"** to choose a specific page.

## Apps

### Launching an App
Simply **click** on any app icon to launch it.

### App Context Menu (Right-Click)

<img src="../images/app-context-menu.png" alt="App Context Menu" width="250">

Right-click on any app icon to access a context menu with options that vary based on where the app is located:

#### For Ungrouped Apps (Main Window)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create New Group** | Creates a new group containing this app |
| **Add to Group →** | Shows a submenu listing all existing groups (sorted alphabetically). Select a group to add the app to it |

#### For Apps Inside a Group (Group Popup)

<img src="../images/group-app-context-menu.png" alt="Group App Context Menu" width="250">

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Move to New Group** | Removes the app from the current group and creates a new group with it |
| **Move to Group →** | Shows a submenu of other groups (excludes current group). Select to move the app there |
| **Move to Page →** | *(Only appears if group has multiple pages)* Move the app to a different page within the same group |
| **Remove from Group** | Returns the app to the ungrouped section |

> **Tip:** The group list in the context menu is sorted alphabetically, making it easy to find the group you want.

### App Icons
- Apps display their native macOS icons

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Multi-Select

<img src="../images/multi-select.png" alt="Multi-Select" width="500">

My Launchpad supports selecting multiple apps at once using keyboard modifiers, making it easy to organize many apps quickly.

### Selection Methods

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Click** (in edit mode) | Selects only that app, clears other selections |
| **Shift+Click** | Selects all apps from the last selected to the clicked app (range selection) |
| **Command+Click** | Toggles the clicked app without affecting other selections |

### How to Use Multi-Select

1. **Enter Edit Mode** - Long-press on any app or use the edit button
2. **Select Apps**:
   - Click the first app you want to select
   - **Shift+Click** another app to select the entire range between them
   - **Command+Click** to add or remove individual apps from your selection
3. **Perform Actions** - Right-click on any selected app to:
   - Create a new group with all selected apps
   - Add all selected apps to an existing group

### Tips

- Selected apps show a blue checkmark overlay
- The selection works in the main Apps section (ungrouped apps)
- Use Shift+Click for selecting many consecutive apps quickly
- Use Command+Click for picking specific apps scattered throughout the list
- Icons scale based on the group tile size setting
- Hovering over an app shows a subtle highlight effect

## Settings

<img src="../images/settings.png" alt="Settings Panel" width="300">

Access settings by clicking the **gear icon** in the top-right corner.

> **Smart Panel Behavior:** Only one panel can be open at a time. Opening settings will close any open group popup, and clicking on a group will close the settings panel.

### Available Settings

#### Group Header Color
Choose the color for group popup headers using the color picker. Default is purple.

#### Group Tile Size
Select the size of group tiles:
- **S** (Small) - 0.8x scale
- **M** (Medium) - 1.1x scale (default)
- **L** (Large) - 1.3x scale

#### Save My Settings
Use the Export and Import buttons to back up and restore your launcher configuration.

**Export** - Save all your launcher settings to a JSON file. This includes:
- All groups and their names
- App organization within groups
- Ungrouped app order

Use this to:
- Back up your configuration
- Transfer settings to another Mac
- Share your setup with others

**Import** - Restore settings from a previously exported file. The import process:
- Matches apps by their file path on your system
- Recreates your groups with the same names and organization
- Any apps that no longer exist on your system will be skipped
- New apps not in the imported settings will appear in the ungrouped section

> **Note:** Importing will replace your current groups and organization with the imported settings.

#### Cloud Backup

Keep your settings synced across multiple Macs using cloud storage:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **iCloud** | When enabled, automatically backs up settings to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/My Launchpad/` using a date-prefixed, device-specific filename |
| **OneDrive** | When enabled, automatically backs up settings to `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/My Launchpad/` using a date-prefixed, device-specific filename |

**How Cloud Sync Works:**
1. Enable one or both cloud backup options in Settings
2. Your configuration is automatically saved to the cloud whenever you make changes, with a filename that begins with `YYMMDD - ` and includes your device name
3. On another Mac (signed into the same cloud account), open Settings and choose **Import**
4. Browse to the cloud folder and select the backup file you want to restore

> My Launchpad never prompts you to restore automatically. Restoring cloud settings is always a manual choice you make from Settings.

> **Example filename:** `260824 - My Launchpad Backup - Bartbis MacBook Pro.json`

> **Export default filename:** `260824 - My Launchpad Settings - Bartbis MacBook Pro.json`

> **Tip:** This is perfect for keeping your app organization consistent across a MacBook and desktop Mac!

#### Behavior Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hide on launch** | When enabled, the launcher automatically hides after you launch an app (default: ON) |
| **Hide on focus lost** | When enabled, the launcher automatically hides when you click outside its window (default: ON) |

These settings help keep the launcher out of your way while still being instantly accessible via the global hotkey (⌃⌥Space).

## Pinned Apps

<img src="../images/pinned-app.png" alt="Pinned App on Grid" width="500">

Pinned apps are standalone app tiles that appear directly on the main grid alongside your groups. They give you one-click access to your most-used apps without needing to open a group first.

### Pinning an App to the Grid

There are two ways to pin an app:

#### Drag to Pin
1. Find the app in the **Apps** section at the bottom of the window
2. **Drag** the app up to the main grid area
3. **Drop** it at the exact position where you want it to appear
4. The app appears as a standalone tile on the grid

#### Pin Button (Edit Mode)

<img src="../images/pin-button.png" alt="Pin Button in Edit Mode" width="500">

1. **Enter Edit Mode** — Long-press on any app or group tile
2. Each app in the Apps section displays an **orange pin icon** (📌) in the top-right corner
3. **Click the pin icon** to instantly pin that app to the grid
4. The app is added as a standalone tile at the end of the grid

### Unpinning an App from the Grid

<img src="../images/unpin-button.png" alt="Unpin Button in Edit Mode" width="500">

1. **Enter Edit Mode** — Long-press on any app or group tile
2. Each pinned app on the grid displays an **orange unpin icon** (pin with slash) in the top-right corner
3. **Click the unpin icon** to remove the app from the grid
4. The app remains available in the Apps section

### Repositioning Pinned Apps

Pinned apps can be repositioned on the grid by dragging:

1. **Drag** a pinned app tile to a new position on the grid
2. The drop position is **row-aware** — the app lands exactly where you drop it on the target row
3. **Drop near the edge** of a group tile to insert at that position (reorder)
4. **Drop on the center** of a group tile to add the app to that group instead

> **Tip:** Pinned apps and groups share the same grid, so you can freely mix standalone apps with group tiles for the perfect layout.

## Drag and Drop

<img src="../images/drag-and-drop.png" alt="Drag and Drop" width="500">

### Adding Apps to Groups
Drag an app onto a group icon to add it to that group.

### Pinning Apps to the Grid
Drag an app from the **Apps** section and drop it onto the main grid to pin it as a standalone tile. The app appears at the exact position where you drop it. See [Pinned Apps](#pinned-apps) for details.

### Reordering Apps Within a Group
In the group popup:
- **Drop ON an app** - Inserts at that position, pushing other apps forward
- **Drop to the LEFT of an app** - Inserts before that app
- **Drop to the RIGHT** - Inserts after (at end of row or end of list)
- **Drop on empty slot** - Places the app in that empty position

### Repositioning Pinned Apps on the Grid
Drag a pinned app tile to move it:
- **Drop near the edge** of another tile — Inserts at that position (reorder)
- **Drop on the center** of a group tile — Adds the app to that group
- Position is **row-aware** — the app lands on the exact row where you release it

### Moving Apps Between Pages
In multi-page groups:
- **Drag to edge** - Flip to prev/next page while continuing to drag
- **Drop anywhere** - App fills first empty slot or drops at position
- **Empty slot left behind** - Source page keeps an empty slot (up to 4)

### Reordering Groups
On the main screen:
- **Drop ON a group** - Swaps positions with that group
- **Drop to the LEFT of a group** - Inserts before that group
- **Drop to the RIGHT of a group** - Inserts after that group

### Moving Apps Between Groups
Use the context menu to move apps between groups, or drag from ungrouped to a group.
